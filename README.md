# 🎨 Accessibility UI Study

Welcome to the repository dedicated to studying UI accessibility (a11y). This is a personal space focused on delving deep into the intricacies of accessible UI development.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

This project leverages the following remarkable technologies:

- **[React](https://react.dev/)**: 📚 A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: ✍️ A strongly typed superset of JavaScript.
- **[Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)**: 🚀 A build tool offering a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: 🎨 A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**: 📖 An open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation.

## 🔍 Prerequisites

To ensure a seamless development experience, you'll need:

- **[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)** (v18.18.0) 🟢 

For consistent environment settings and to minimize issues due to version discrepancies, we've locked the Node.js version to **v18.18.0**. It's recommended to use tools like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) 🔄 to manage multiple Node.js environments. The `.tool-versions` file at the project root specifies the required Node.js version.
